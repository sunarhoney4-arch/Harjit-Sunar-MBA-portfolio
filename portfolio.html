    <h3>GridSmart — Renewable Energy Project Prioritization</h3>
    <p>
      Employed SWOT and Critical Path Method (CPM) analyses to create a proposal for a portfolio management framework to prioritize regional renewable
      energy projects. Proposed success metrics (e.g., Return on Investment, Megawatt-Hours Generated) and governance KPIs tracked via centralized, interactive
      dashboards (Project Management Institute, 2024).
    </p>
    <p><em>Case Summary →</em> GridSmart is a strategic initiative aimed at optimizing investment in solar and wind farm development. The proposal outlines a framework for
      a centralized Project Management Office (PMO) responsible for project selection, resource allocation, and risk mitigation, ensuring all energy infrastructure
      initiatives align with federal sustainability goals and regional energy demands.
